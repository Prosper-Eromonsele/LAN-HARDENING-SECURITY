# LAN-HARDENING-SECURITY
This project demonstrates LAN Hardening on a Cisco topology by mitigating Layer 2 attacks. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I implemented Port Security to stop MAC flooding, DHCP Snooping to block rogue servers, and DAI to prevent ARP spoofing. It showcases a secure, redundant architecture designed to protect the network's integrity.
