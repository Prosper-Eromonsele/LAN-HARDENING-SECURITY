<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<br>This project marks a significant milestone in advancing the company's IT capabilities while adhering to strict space and budget limitations. By leveraging virtualization technologies, I successfully transformed a constrained environment into a secure, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure. The deployment of key components including a Web Server, Router-Firewall, DNS Server, DMZ, and dedicated workstations ensures robust performance, enhanced security, and future-proof flexibility.
The implementation not only meets current operational demands but also lays a solid foundation for seamless expansion and integration of future technologies. Through strategic planning and execution, this project demonstrates how innovative thinking and technical expertise can overcome resource limitations and deliver enterprise-grade solutions.
As one of my key projects, it reflects my commitment to practical problem-solving, secure system design, and scalable architecture core principles that I will continue to apply in future IT initiatives.
